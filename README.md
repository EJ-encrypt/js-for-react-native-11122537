# Student ID: [11122537]

# Task 1: Create `arrayManipulation.js` and `processArray` Function
- Created a file named `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Added the `processArray` function which:
  - Takes an array of numbers as input.
  - Uses the `map` method to create a new array.
  - Squares each even number and triples each odd number.
  - Returns the new array with the transformed numbers.
  - Exports the function for use in other files.

# Task 2: Add `formatArrayStrings` Function
- Continued editing `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Added the `formatArrayStrings` function which:
  - Takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`.
  - Uses the `map` method to create a new array.
  - Capitalizes each string if the corresponding number is even and converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.
  - Returns the new array with the transformed strings.
  - Exports the function along with `processArray` for use in other files.

# Task 3: Create `userInfo.js` and `createUserProfiles` Function
- Created a file named `userInfo.js`.
- Added the `createUserProfiles` function which:
  - Takes two arrays as input: an array of original names and an array of modified names.
  - Uses the `map` method to create a new array of objects.
  - Each object contains `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
  - Returns the new array of user profile objects.
  - Exports the function for use in other files.
